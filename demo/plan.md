# Demo Presentation Plan

This document outlines the setup for demonstrating AI-powered review of HTML design and development assignments.

## 1. Demo Folder Structure

The `demo` folder contains the following:
- `rubric.md`: The grading rubric and scale for HTML assignments.
- `assignments/`: A folder containing simulated student assignments.
    - `assignment1_excellent.html` and `style_excellent.css`: Represents an excellent submission, demonstrating strong HTML structure, effective CSS, and best practices.
    - `assignment2_satisfactory.html`: Represents a satisfactory submission, with basic HTML/CSS, some inconsistencies, and areas for improvement.
    - `assignment3_poor.html`: Represents a submission that needs significant improvement, with poor structure, inline styles, and lack of best practices.

## 2. Presentation Flow

1.  **Introduce the Problem:** Explain the challenge of manually reviewing HTML design and development assignments and the desire to automate this process using AI.
2.  **Present the Rubric:** Show `rubric.md` and explain the criteria (HTML Structure, CSS Styling, Content, Interactivity, Best Practices) and the 60% exigency grading scale.
3.  **Review Simulated Assignments:**
    *   **Assignment 1 (Excellent):** Open `demo/assignments/assignment1_excellent.html` and `demo/assignments/style_excellent.css`. Highlight its strengths based on the rubric. Explain how AI could easily identify its adherence to best practices.
    *   **Assignment 2 (Satisfactory):** Open `demo/assignments/assignment2_satisfactory.html`. Point out areas where it meets satisfactory criteria and where it could be improved according to the rubric. Discuss how AI could provide targeted feedback for these improvements.
    *   **Assignment 3 (Needs Improvement):** Open `demo/assignments/assignment3_poor.html`. Demonstrate the clear deficiencies in HTML structure, styling, and best practices. Emphasize how AI could quickly identify these issues and suggest fundamental corrections.
4.  **Discuss AI Effectiveness:** Summarize how AI can:
    *   Apply the rubric consistently.
    *   Identify specific HTML/CSS errors and violations of best practices.
    *   Provide detailed, actionable feedback to students.
    *   Automate grading based on predefined scales.
5.  **Next Steps (Conceptual):** Briefly mention how this demo could lead to integrating AI review tools into the existing workflow.
