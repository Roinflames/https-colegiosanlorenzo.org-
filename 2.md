3rd Year Students: BDD and Software Development

  Goal: Prepare for the "BDD integration for API Widget GUI desktop" (13/11) and "Practical situation 3 dimensions of software development" (27/11) evaluations.

  Day 1 (Today, October 28th): Introduction to BDD

   * Morning (90 min):
       * Introduction to Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).
       * The "Given-When-Then" structure of BDD scenarios.
       * Introduction to Gherkin syntax for writing feature files.
       * Activity: Students will write simple Gherkin scenarios for a familiar application (e.g., a coffee machine, an ATM).
   * Afternoon (90 min):
       * Introduction to a BDD framework (e.g., Behave for Python).
       * Setting up a project with the chosen BDD framework.
       * Writing step definitions to implement the Gherkin scenarios.
       * Activity: Students will implement the step definitions for the scenarios they wrote in the morning.

  Day 2 (October 29th): BDD for GUI and API

   * Morning (90 min):
       * How to use BDD to test a GUI application.
       * Introduction to a GUI automation library (e.g., Selenium, PyAutoGUI).
       * Activity: Students will write and implement a Gherkin scenario that interacts with a simple GUI application.
   * Afternoon (90 min):
       * How to use BDD to test an API.
       * Introduction to an HTTP client library (e.g., Requests for Python).
       * Activity: Students will write and implement a Gherkin scenario that sends a request to a fake API and verifies the response.


   * Morning (90 min):
       * Introduction to the "3 dimensions of software development": Technology, People, and Process.
       * Case Study: I will present a case study of a fictional company that needs a new internal tool.
       * Activity: In groups, students will brainstorm and discuss the requirements for the new tool, considering the 3 dimensions.
   * Afternoon (90 min):
       * Students will begin designing the application from the case study.
       * They will create a high-level architectural design.
       * They will write a few Gherkin scenarios for the application, covering both GUI and API interactions.
       * Activity: Students will present their design and BDD scenarios to the class.
